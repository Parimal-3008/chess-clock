# chess-clock
Not every chess player can have a chess clock for over the board games
So in this project I have made a chess clock.
Features:
-> Players can choose game format they want to play
-> They can set their initial time as well as increment time 
-> There is also the feature of time control if you wants to play a classical game 
-> If a player thinks he is playing against a relatively weak opponent then he/she can choose whether he wants an increment in time after playing a certain move or not or even can set less time depending what he/she wants
-> After making a move player has to just press SPACE BAR key just like they press the chess clocks.
